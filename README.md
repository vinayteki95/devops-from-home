# If DevOps is a culture, how do you study for that ?

## What is Devops ?

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/):
  DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity

[WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps):
  DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

[MICROSOFT](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/):
  A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.

## Okay! What are we dealing with here ?

All the jargon above sounds to me like it's more of a culture (a pattern of behaviour) that a team of people practice to achieve optimal development lifecycle in the Tech industry.

## Then what/who is a DevOps engineer here ?

This is probably the coolest part for me. A DevOps engineer is someone who ensures and manages this culture with every resource out there.

Sounds like a lot of responsibility. That is why we have an **engineer** for that role. Some one who can understand, utilize and innovate with **technology** to make this happen.

## The learning strategy (Finally!!)

Going through the **rise and evolution of DevOps** culture in a **simulated environment** should do it. (Obviously)

## What do you have to know to do that ?

Let's not go into the details of what DevOps is because there are 1000s of articles and tutorials out there for us to make the most out of.

- We are here to explore a **learning strategy** to acquire the skills of a typical DevOps engineer in a more abstract format.

- Let's speculate through a ficticious narrative of the rise and evolution of devops in a company.

- Everytime there is a new heavy lifting scenario the DevOps guy changes the blueprint of the tech infrastructure by **automating that operation**.

We tried to demonstrate the tech architecture of a company and how it evolves in the illustration above.

    Note: there are quite a few missing pieces in the above illustration but it'll be tedious for one to go through every possible technology at once and consumes way too much time if one has to generate these illustrations for every possible scenario.
  
    For example I skipped the GIT BRANCHING STRATEGY, DEPLOYMENT / ROLE OUT METHODS, DIFFERENT TYPES OF TESTING - UAT, SMOKE, INTEGRATION, etc.

- It is clear that a company would go through such a transformation organically by realizing inadequacies in the **Software Development Life Cycle** and improvising it. All we need to do is simulate the same environment and actually implement the architecture required to solve the problem.

- It is highly beneficial to implement each phase of infrastructure maturity and evolve it, rather than skipping to the last design (because there is no last design - we can automate and smoothen our pipeline forever). The reason is simple, a devops engineer will never be asked to build an entire pipeline at once. One would have to modify the current infrastucture and introduce new technologies without any downtime.

## Conclusion:

The idea is straight forward here. The transition from being a sysadmin or a developer to a DevOps engineer on the fly is in itself the skill a DevOps engineer possess. Learning a new technology takes a day or few to master it where as it takes an organisation to technologically scale and mature to produce a DevOps engineer.
